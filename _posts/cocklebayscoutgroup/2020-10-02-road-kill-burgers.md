Read this one carefully

6 serves

## Ingredients for Scouts

* Lump of road-kill meat
* 1 container of grated cabbage tree shoots
* 1 container of rabbits testicles
* 1 container of butchers shop floor sawdust
* Mustard sauce
* Salt and pepper
* Tomato sauce
* 6 bread rolls

## Method

Mash the rabbits testicles in a bowl with a fork

Add all the other ingredients to the mashed rabbit testicles and mix thoroughly

Form into balls with wet hands and then flatten to make even thickness patties of about 1 cm

Gently cook on a BBQ or in a frying pan until cooked through

Serve in rolls with tomato sauce and mustard as desired.

## Guidance for leaders

Leaders prepare the mix as directed so that the meat does in fact look like road kill

Chop and put the courgette and herbs etc into bags labeled as directed and give everything (all 5 bowls or bags) to each team of six to cook

* Thyme, chives and parsley
* 1 can of chickpeas
* 2 tbsp of breadcrumbs
* Mustard sauce
* Salt and pepper
* Tomato sauce

## Preparation Method

Roughly mix the road-kill meat (ground beef), tomato paste, and grated beetroot to give the appearance of dark red dirty meat. Cover with a broken-up stock cube or powder to simulate more dirt

Mix together chopped fresh herbs such as thyme, chives and parsley and label container "Grass Clippings"

Drain a can of chickpeas, bag up 2 tbsp and label container "Rabbit’s Testicles"
